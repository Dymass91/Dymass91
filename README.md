  <h2>Hi there:wave: I am Tomasz and I want to tell you a bit about me :wink:</h2>

  **Why coding?**  From an early age, my entertainment was doing power point animations.
  And then over the years I realized that I needed to find a job that I could
  be professionally fulfilled and additionally receive money for it. And a couple of years ago
  I decided that I need to find my plot in IT that I will match,
  So I turned to my devops friend who has been in the IT industry for many years for advice.
  And he recommended the Front-End to me and it was a bull's-eye, right now
  I liked this plot and decided that it is definitely what I want to do for the rest of my life.
  
  **My experience with programing?** I started my programing story with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I have the most experience in them and most of my projects.
  Later came React.js which I liked very much in my portfolio there is one project built in this framework and
  then I got some experience with MySql, PHP, and Wordpress to be able to do projects by myself for clients that I managed to acquire, 
  but in my heart I feel that my place is working with React.js.
